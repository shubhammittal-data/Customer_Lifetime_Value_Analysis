# Customer_Lifetime_Value_Analysis
# 📊 Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) Analysis using Python

## 📌 Introduction
Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) analysis is used to estimate the **total value of customers** to a business over the lifetime of their relationship. This project analyzes **customer acquisition costs, conversion rates, revenue, return on investment (ROI), and CLTV** across different acquisition channels.

By understanding **CLTV**, businesses can:
- **Optimize marketing spend** by focusing on high-value customers.
- **Improve customer retention** through data-driven strategies.
- **Identify the most profitable acquisition channels**.
